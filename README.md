Simple melody generator trained on 200 melodies from https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/.
For simplicity's sake it only predicts the pitch(or pitches) of the next note/chord in the sequence. As a result the output has no pauses and all the sounds are of equal length.
Training took about 8.5h on Google Colab's T4.
Heavily inspired by https://github.com/Skuldur/Classical-Piano-Composer
